{"name":"Dali","tagline":"Non-Gaussian Likelihood Approximations","body":"DALI is a fast approximation of non-Gaussian likelihoods. It extends the well-known Fisher Matrix in a straightforward way. The code is written in C/C++.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe code has a Doxygen documentation and a handwritten manual. If the code gives you a hard time, please criticize the manuals before you criticize the code: the code had many, many test runs whereas the documentation had none. It is still subject to improvement and helpful criticism is very welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\nIf you used DALI in a publication of yours, please cite the corresponding release papers:\r\n* \"Breaking the spell of Gaussianity: forecasting with higher order Fisher matrices\", E.
