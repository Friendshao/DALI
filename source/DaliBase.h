     *Storage room for the data. The structure <vector<vector<double > > works like a C-array ar[i][j], and is also called like this: datavaribs[i][j] is the jth independent variable if the ith datapoint. I.e. each datavaribs[i][j] is of type double. Each datavaribs[i] is a vector of doubles.
     * Each of the vectors datavaribs[i] will later be inserted into the
     * PhysMod, as a point where derivatives are taken. Make sure to correctly distribute your data into this array. If you have 50 data points, the index i of datavaribs[i][j] will run from 0 to 49. If you have only one independent variable, only datavaribs[i][0] will exist. So a cosmologist could for example set datavaribs[i][0] = redshift[i]. The code resizes datavaribs for you: it will have dimensions noofdat (the number of datapoints) times indep (the number of independent variables).  Do not resize this vector to your convenience! Also don't use push_back().
