Since Last Publication (24th Feb), the following things were done:

- included a flag is_diag for the covariance matrix inversion 
- allow concatenating of chains in "LoadChain"
-included a function lowmemory, because for huge covariance matrices 8 GB might not be enough because of all the derivatives...

-included pythonconours_w and used that in FisherMargins: Fisher ellipses will now be grey

-preparing for better control of derivatives: included vectors M_step, M_dstep, M_tstep

- speed up second deriv-calculation: Using existing covmatrix, instead of recalculating it
